# AI-Powered Tool for Investigating CEF Effects on Magnetic Properties of Rare-Earth Intermetallic Compounds

This project introduces a novel tool based on Artificial Intelligence to support research in condensed matter physics. It focuses on predicting the magnetic properties of rare-earth intermetallic compounds by simulating and analyzing the effects of the Crystalline Electric Field (CEF).

## üß† Project Overview

The correct description of magnetic properties in rare-earth compounds heavily depends on CEF effects. Traditionally, these effects are investigated through experimental techniques such as neutron scattering, X-ray absorption, or M√∂ssbauer spectroscopy.

As an alternative approach, we developed an intelligent system capable of:

- Performing parameter fitting based on magnetic characterization measurements
- Simulating magnetic properties such as magnetization, specific heat, and susceptibility
- Responding to domain-specific scientific questions through Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## üõ† Architecture

The architecture is composed of several components:

- **LangChain Framework**: Orchestrates LLM-based workflows.
- **LLM Integration**: Compatible with a wide range of language models, allowing flexible deployment based on local infrastructure or cloud resources.
- **Julia Backend**: Executes the core magnetic simulations and parameter fitting routines.
- **Ollama**: Hosts the language model locally.
- **Streamlit**: Serves the tool via a web-based interface.

## üî¨ Methodology

Simulations are performed based on a Hamiltonian that incorporates the CEF, applied to a selected magnetic sublattice. The system enables the simultaneous fitting of experimental data:

- Magnetization vs. Magnetic Field
- Susceptibility vs. Temperature
- Specific Heat

This is made possible by chaining LLM-driven logic with scientific computation modules in Julia.

## üåê Web Integration

The tool is deployed as a web application and exposes its features via an API. This makes it accessible across platforms and enables automation of research workflows.
